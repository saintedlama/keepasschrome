KeePass Chrome
==============

KeepPass Chrome is a Chrome app that allows you to access your 
KeePass password safe. 
It works offline by directly loading your .kdbx files, rather
than using KeePassHTTP. KeePass Chrome is especially useful with Chromebooks.

Downloading and Installing
-----------
KeePass Chrome can be downloaded and installed on the 
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepass-chrome/dblfjmedcfpfopkkkknpgkokmlnfildj).

To install the bleeding-edge master version, enter the following command on your terminal:

    $ git clone https://github.com/saintedlama/keepasschrome.git  
Afterwards, go to the three-line menu, click on **More Tools** > **Extensions**,
enable **Developer Mode** 
in the checkbox in the upper-right-hand corner of the page,
click **Load unpacked extension...**, and 
open the `app` folder inside the KeePass Chrome repository.
